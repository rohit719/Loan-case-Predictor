# Loan-case-Predictor

Built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Procedure followed :-


Loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications(Link mentioned in the project) 

Cleaned the data by using data pre-processing techniques. 

Used Data Visualization to represent data in graphical form and get insights on the data.

Conveted the attributes in the required form for Model Building.

Normalized the Data as Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance (technically should be done after train test split )

Used different Machine Learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbour,Decision Tree,Support Vector Machine,Logistic Regression and applied it on a dataset for Model Building.

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoass.Calculated and compared F1-SCORE, Jaccard Similarity Score for each model to get maximum accuracy.


Predicted whether loan will be paid off or not over a Dataset with the highest accuracy of 82.76%.
